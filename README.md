# Mario-Clicky-Game

<strong> Purpose of the Game </strong>
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

<p><small> The purpose of the "Mario Clicky Game" is to test your memory. The user/player will click on the boxes (12 in total), and attempt to click on 
a new one each time. If the player clicks on the same box more than once in a sequence, their score will be reverted to zero. How well can you do?
Why not see for youself? </small></p>

  and I made sure to search for pictures of the characters in their carts for aesthetic purposes. </i>
